Configure the <code>routing/_api.router/_groups</code> manifest property with the same range of ports that you configured your LB with in step three above. 
	```
		routing_api.router_groups:
		      - name: default-tcp
		        reservable_ports: 1024-1123
		        type: tcp
    ```
See the <a href ="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/routing-release">CF Routing Release Github page </a> for more information. To modify the ports after you have deployed, see the [Post-deployment steps: Modify your TCP Ports](#modify-port) topic below.
