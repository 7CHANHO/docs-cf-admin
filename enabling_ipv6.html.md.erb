title: Enabling IPv6 for Applications on Cloud Foundry
---

This topic describes how to enable IPv6 for Cloud Foundry application domains.

As IPv4 addresses are in limited supply, operators may want Cloud Foundry's public interfaces to be addressable using IPv6. The procedure described below allows apps deployed to Cloud Foundry to be reached using IPv6 addresses.

Cloud Foundry internal components use DNS names to connect to one another. These DNS names typically resolve to the IP address of a load balancer. However, Cloud Foundry system components currently support only IPv4 DNS resolved addresses. IPv4 addresses are necessary because BOSH, the VM orchestration tool used to deploy Cloud Foundry, does not currently support assignment of IPv6 addresses to the VMs it manages. This means that although an IPv6 address can be used for application domains, the system domain must resolve to an IPv4 address.

To support IPv6 for application domains, complete the following steps:

1. Configure DNS to resolve application domains to an IPv6 address on an external load balancer (not the one that comes with Cloud Foundry). 

1. Configure the external load balancer to route requests for an IPv6 address to a Cloud Foundry IPv4 address as follows:
	- If you are using the Cloud Foundry load balancer for SSL termination, route to its IPv4 address.
	- Otherwise, route directly to the IPv4 address of the Cloud Foundry routing tier.

Your IPv4 interface for the system domain, and IPv6 interfaces for application domains can be configured on the same or different load balancers.
