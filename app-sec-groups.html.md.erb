This topic describes how to secure the component VMs of your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment from being accessed by apps. 

## <a id='overview'></a> Introduction ##

See the following list to understand the concepts for this topic:

* **How PCF determines where apps can send traffic**: 
  * PCF uses _Application Security Groups (ASGs)_, which are rules that specify the protocols, ports, and IP addresses that apps can send traffic to. See [Understanding ASGs](../concepts/asg.html).
* **Why you must create new rules for outbound app traffic**: 
  * PCF installs with a [default ASG](./concepts/asg.html#default-asg) that allows apps running on your deployment to send traffic to any IP address, which means internal PCF components are vulnerable to untrusted code.
* **How you can set up new rules**: 
  * To help secure your component VMs against apps while ensuring your apps can access the services they need, follow the [procedure](#procedure) below, which includes these steps:

    </tr>
    </table>

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites ##

The procedure below requires that you have the latest release of [ASG Creator](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/asg-creator/releases/latest) from the Cloud Foundry incubator repository on Github. See [About the ASG Creator Tool](../concepts/asg.html#asg-baseline)


## <a id='procedure'></a> Procedure

Follow these steps to apply ASGs that prevent apps running on your deployment from accessing internal PCF components. 

### <a name='network'></a> Step 1: Determine Your Network Layout ##

The procedure for securing your deployment with ASGs varies depending on your network layout, which you can determine by following these steps: 

1. Log in to Ops Manager. 

1. For each tile, click **Assign AZs and Networks** and record the selected **Network** that the tile is installed on. 

1. Based on the information you gathered, determine which of the following network layouts you have:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Layout Name</th>
      <th>Layout Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>One Network</td>
      <td><ul><li>One network for Ops Manager and the Ops Manager Director, Elastic Runtime, and services.</li></ul>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You cannot secure your deployment with ASGs if you have this network layout. Because PCF dynamically allocates IPs, they cannot be easily excluded in the case of a single network.</p>  
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Two Networks</td>
      <td><ul><li>One network for Ops Manager and the Ops Manager Director.</li>
          <li>One network for Elastic Runtime and Services.</li></ul></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Three Networks</td>
      <td><ul><li>One network for Ops Manager and the Ops Manager Director.</li>
          <li>One network for Elastic Runtime.</li>
          <li>One network for all services.</li></ul></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Three or More Networks</td>
      <td><ul><li>One network for Ops Manager and the Ops Manager Director.</li>
          <li>One network for Elastic Runtime.</li>
          <li>One network for each service.</ul></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

1. If your network layout includes two or more networks, continue [Step 2: Ensure Access for PCF System Apps](#bind-default).

### <a name='bind-default'></a> Step 2: Ensure Access for PCF System Apps ##

Follow these steps to apply the default ASG to the `system` org. This provides network access to PCF system apps without restrictions, which enables them to continue functioning properly after you perform [Step 4: Remove the Deployment-wide Default ASG Binding](#unbind-default).

1. Bind the default ASG to the [staging set](../concepts.html/asg.html#asg-sets) in the `system` org:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf bind-staging-security-group default\_security\_group system</pre>

1. Bind the default ASG to the [running set](../concepts.html/asg.html#asg-sets) in the `system` org:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf bind-running-security-group default\_security\_group system</pre>

### <a name='initial'></a> Step 3: Create New ASGs ##

Follow these steps to create ASGs that block apps from accessing PCF components and create any additional ASGs that allow apps to access the services they require. 

#### <a name='get-cidrs'></a> Part A: Record CIDRs

Gather the CIDRs for each network in your deployment:

1. From the Ops Manager Director tile, click **Create Networks** within the **Settings** tab.

1. In the **Networks** section, expand each network in your deployment by clicking its name.

1. Record the **CIDR** for each network.

#### <a name='initial-asgs'></a> Part B: Create and Bind ASGs that Block Network Access

Create ASGs that block apps from sending traffic to the networks that host Ops Manager, Elastic Runtime, and (optional) any services installed. 

1. Create a `config.yml` containing the appropriate content for your network layout and replace the indicated values with the CIDRs you gathered:
  * **Two Network Layout**:

        ```
        excluded_networks:
        - YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-CIDR
        - YOUR-ELASTIC-RUNTIME-AND-SERVICES-CIDR
        ```
   * **Three Network Layout**:
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you only want to secure the Ops Manager and Elastic Runtime components, you can optionally exclude the services CIDR.</p>

         ```
          excluded_networks:
          - YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-CIDR
          - YOUR-ELASTIC-RUNTIME-CIDR
          - YOUR-SERVICES-CIDR
         ```
    * **Three or More Network Layout**:
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you only want to secure the Ops Manager and Elastic Runtime components, you can optionally exclude the services CIDRs.</p>

        ```
        excluded_networks:
        - YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-CIDR
        - YOUR-ELASTIC-RUNTIME-CIDR
        - YOUR-SERVICE-CIDR-1
        - YOUR-SERVICE-CIDR-2
        etc...
        ```

1. Run the following command to create a `json` that contains ASG rules, using your `config.yml` as input:   
  <pre class="terminal">$ asg-creator create --config config.yml --output OUTPUT-FILE-NAME.json</pre>
  Replace `OUTPUT-FILE-NAME` with a name of your choice.

1. Create an ASG by running the following command:
  1. Replace `SECURITY-GROUP-NAME` with a name of your choice.
  1. Replace `OUTPUT-FILE-NAME` with the name of the generated file from the previous step. 
  <pre class="terminal">$ create-security-group SECURITY-GROUP-NAME OUTPUT-FILE-NAME.json</pre>

1. Bind the ASG to the default staging set:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf bind-staging-security-group SECURITY-GROUP-NAME</pre>

1. Bind the ASG to the default running set:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf bind-running-security-group SECURITY-GROUP-NAME</pre>

#### <a name='service-access'></a> Part C: Create and Bind ASGs for Service Access

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This part is only necessary if you blocked apps from a network that hosts services in the previous part. If you did not block apps from a network that hosts services, proceed to <a href="undbind-default">Step 4: Remove the Default ASG</a>.
</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: In the two network layout, Elastic Runtime and services share the same network. This means that each time you create an ASG that allows apps to access a new port/protocol within the network, you further expose the Elastic Runtime component VMs. This is a limitation of a two network layout. For guidance on network topology, see <a href="../refarch/index.html">Reference Architectures</a>.</p>

Now that you have created ASGs to secure the Ops Man, Elastic Runtime, and service components, work with developers to create additional ASGs that give apps access to the services they need. 
  
For example, in any space where apps need to access the MySQL for PCF service, follow the steps in [Creating Application Security Groups for MySQL](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/app-security-groups.html). 

For more information on creating and binding ASGs, see the following:

* [Procedures for Working with ASGs](../concepts/asg.html#procedures)
* [Typical ASGs](../concepts/asg.html#typical-groups) 
   
 

### <a name='unbind-default'></a> Step 4: Remove the Default ASG

Now that you have bound new ASGs to determine outbound traffic rules, you no longer need the default ASG bindings that allow apps to send traffic to any IP.

1. Unbind the default ASG from the staging set:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf unbind-staging-security-group default\_security\_group</pre>

1. Unbind the default ASG from the running set:
    <pre class="terminal">$ cf unbind-running-security-group default\_security\_group</pre>


### <a name='restart'></a> Step 5: Restart your Apps

To apply the ASG changes, you must restart all of the apps in your deployment. To mitigate app downtime during the restart, Pivotal recommends a [blue-green](../devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html) deployment strategy.

<p class="note"><strong>Notes</strong>: You do not need to restart the apps in the <code>system</code> org.</p>

1. Work with developers to restart a few of their apps individually and test that they still work correctly with the new ASGs in place. If an app does not work as expected, you likely must create another ASG that allows the app to send traffic to a service it requires. 
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To quickly roll back to the original overly-permissive state, you can re-bind the <code>default\_security\_group</code> ASG to the <code>default-staging</code> and <code>default-running</code> sets. You must then restart your apps to re-apply the original ASGs.</p>

1. Restart the rest of the apps running on your deployment. Optionally, you can use the [app-restarter cf CLI plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/app-restarter) to restart all apps in a particular space, org, or deployment.
