_This page assumes you are using [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) v6.4 or higher._

<%= vars.product_full %> blocks all outbound network connections from
application containers by default. Administrators can override this block-by-default behavior with Application Security
Groups (ASGs).

ASGs are a collection of egress rules that specify one or more individual
protocols, ports, and destinations to allow network access to.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: For examples of typical ASGs, see <a href="#typical-groups">Typical Application Security Groups</a>.</p>

<%= vars.product_full %> has two default sets of ASGs: `default-staging` and
`default-running`. All application containers in <%= vars.product_full %> use a
base policy from one of these.

The `default-staging` ASG set applies to application containers that are in the
staging application lifecycle phase. This includes both the buildpack staging
and Docker staging process.

The `default-running` ASG set applies to application containers that are
started and running applications.

In addition to the `default-staging` and `default-running` ASG sets, administrators can configure additional ASGs and bind them to <%= vars.product_full %>
[spaces](../concepts/roles.html#spaces). ASGs bound to spaces add network
access only to the application containers within that space.

When <%= vars.product_full %> creates an application container, the egress rules for the application
container include the following:

* All ASGs in either the `default-staging` or `default-running` set
* All ASGs bound to the space of the application

| `description`   |This is an optional field that contains useful text for operators to manage security group rules.

To create an ASG:

1. Create a rules file as a JSON-formatted single array containing objects that
describe the rules. Refer to the example below, which allows ICMP traffic of
code 1 and type 0 to all destinations, and TCP traffic to 10.0.11.0/24 on ports
80-443:

    ```
    [
      {
        "protocol": "icmp",
        "destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
        "type": 0,
        "code": 1
      },
      {
        "protocol": "tcp",
        "destination": "10.0.11.0/24",
        "ports": "80-443",
        "log": true,
        "description": "Allow http and https traffic from ZoneA"
      }
    ]
    ```

1. Run the following `cf` CLI command, replacing `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group and `PATH-TO-RULES-FILE` with the absolute or relative path to a rules file.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-security-group SECURITY-GROUP PATH-TO-RULES-FILE
</pre>

## <a id='updating-groups'></a>Updating Application Security Groups ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Updating an ASG does not affect started applications until you restart them.</p>

To update an existing ASG, run the following command, replacing `SECURITY-GROUP` with the name of your security group and `PATH-TO-RULES-FILE` with the absolute or relative path to a rules file.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf update-security-group SECURITY-GROUP PATH-TO-RULES-FILE
</pre>

## <a id='binding-groups'></a>Binding Application Security Groups ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Binding an ASG does not affect started applications until you restart them.</p>

To apply an ASG to application containers, you must first bind it to a default set or a space.

To bind an ASG to the `default-staging` set, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-staging-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

To bind an ASG to the `default-running` set, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-running-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

To bind an ASG to a specific space, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-security-group SECURITY-GROUP ORG SPACE
</pre>

To bind an ASG to all of an organization's existing spaces, run the following command (requires CF CLI 6.20.0+):

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-security-group SECURITY-GROUP ORG
</pre>

## <a id='unbinding-groups'></a>Unbinding Application Security Groups ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Unbinding an ASG does not affect started applications until you restart them.</p>

To unbind an ASG from the `default-staging` set, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-staging-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

To unbind an ASG from the `default-running` set, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-running-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

To unbind an ASG from a specific space, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-security-group SECURITY-GROUP ORG SPACE
</pre>

## <a id='deleting-groups'></a>Deleting Application Security Groups ##

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: You can only delete unbound ASGs. See <a href="#unbinding-groups">Unbinding Application Security Groups</a>.</p>

To delete an ASG, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-security-group SECURITY-GROUP
</pre>

## <a id='typical-groups'></a>Typical Application Security Groups ##

Below are examples of typical ASGs. Configure your ASGs in
accordance with your organizationâ€™s network access policy for untrusted
applications.

|ASG                   |For access to
|---                   |---
|`dns`                 |DNS, either public or private
|`public-networks`     |Public networks, excluding IaaS metadata endpoints
|`private-networks`    |Private networks per [RFC-1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918#section-3)
|`load-balancers`      |The internal <%= vars.product_full %> load balancer, others
|`internal-proxies`    |Internal proxies
|`internal-databases`  |Internal databases

### <a id='dns-example'></a>DNS ###

In order to resolve hostnames to IPs, applications require DNS server
connectivity, which typically use port 53. Administrators should create or
update a `dns` ASG with appropriate rules. Administrators may further restrict
the DNS servers to specific IPs or ranges of IPs.

Example `dns` ASG:

```
[
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
    "ports": "53"
  },
  {
    "protocol": "udp",
    "destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
    "ports": "53"
  }
]
```

### <a id='public-networks-example'></a>Public Networks ###

Applications often require public network connectivity to retrieve application dependencies or to integrate with services available on public networks. Example application dependencies include public Maven repositories, NPM, RubyGems, Docker registries and others.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Exclude IaaS metadata endpoints, such as 169.254.169.254, because the metadata endpoint can expose sensitive environment information to untrusted applications. The <code>public_networks</code> example below accounts for this recommendation.</p>

Example `public_networks` ASG:

```
[
  {
    "destination": "0.0.0.0-9.255.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  },
  {
    "destination": "11.0.0.0-169.253.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  },
  {
    "destination": "169.255.0.0-172.15.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  },
  {
    "destination": "172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  },
  {
    "destination": "192.169.0.0-255.255.255.255",
    "protocol": "all"
  }
]
```

### <a id='private-networks-example'></a>Private Networks ###

Network connections that are commonly allowable in private networks include
endpoints such as proxy servers, Docker registries, load balancers, databases,
messaging servers, directory servers, and file servers. Configure appropriate
private network ASGs as appropriate. It may be helpful to use a naming
convention with `private_networks` as part of the ASG name, such as `private_networks_databases`.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Be sure to exclude any private networks/IPs that application containers should not have access to. </p>

Example `private_networks` ASG:

```
[
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255",
    "ports": "443"
  },
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255",
    "ports": "443"
  },
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255",
    "ports": "443"
  }
]
```
### <a id='marketplace-services'></a>Marketplace Services ###

Each installed Marketplace Service requires its own set of ASG rules to
function properly. Please refer to the installation instructions for each
installed Marketplace Service for which ASG rules it requires. See the [Services Overview](../devguide/services/) topic for more information about how to provision and integrate services.
