title: Creating and Managing Users with the cf CLI
---

_This page assumes you are using cf v6._

Using the `cf` Command Line Interface (CLI), an administrator can create users
and manage user roles.
Cloud Foundry uses role-based access control, with each role granting
permissions in either an organization or an application space.

For more information, see [Organizations, Spaces, Roles, and Permissions](../concepts/roles.html).

**Note**: To manage users, organizations, and roles with the `cf` CLI, you must
log in with **UAA Administrator user credentials**. <%=vars.info_loc%>, <%=vars.uaa_cred%> for the UAA admin name and password.

## <a id='create-user'></a>Creating and Deleting Users ##

**Create a new user**: `cf create-user USERNAME PASSWORD`

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf create-user ExampleUser pa55w0rd

  Creating user ExampleUser as admin...
  OK
</pre>

**Delete a user**: `cf delete USERNAME`

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf delete-user ExampleUser

  Really delete user ExampleUser?> yes
  Deleting user ExampleUser as admin...
  OK
</pre>

### <a id='create-admin'></a>Creating Administrator Accounts ###

To create a new administrator account, use the [UAA CLI](./uaa-user-management.html#creating-admin-users).

**Note**: The `cf` CLI cannot create new administrator accounts.

## <a id='orgs-spaces'></a>Org and App Space Roles ##

A user can have one or more roles.
The combination of these roles defines the userâ€™s overall permissions in the org
and within specific app spaces in that org.

### <a id='org-roles'></a>Org Roles ###

Valid [org roles](../concepts/roles.html#org-roles) are _OrgManager_, _BillingManager_, and _OrgAuditor_.

**View the organizations belonging to an account**: `cf orgs`

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf orgs

  Getting orgs as admin...

  name
  example-org
  my-department
</pre>

**View all users in an organization by role**: `cf org-users ORGANIZATION_NAME`

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf org-users example-org

  Getting users in org example-org as admin...

  ORG MANAGER
    alice
    cybelle

  BILLING MANAGER
    bertram

  ORG AUDITOR
</pre>

**Assign an org role to a user**: `cf set-org-role USERNAME ORGANIZATION_NAME ROLE`

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf set-org-role ExampleUser example-org OrgManager

  Assigning role OrgManager to user ExampleUser in org example-org as admin...
  OK
</pre>

**Remove an org role from a user**: `cf unset-org-role USERNAME ORGANIZATION_NAME ROLE`

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf unset-org-role ExampleUser example-org OrgManager

  Removing role OrgManager to user ExampleUser in org example-org as admin...
  OK
</pre>

### <a id='space-roles'></a>App Space Roles ###

Each app space role applies to a specific app space.

**Note**: By default, the org manager has app space manager permissions for all spaces within the organization.

Valid [apps space roles](../concepts/roles.html#space-roles) are _SpaceManager_, _SpaceDeveloper_, and _SpaceAuditor_.

**View the spaces in an org**: `cf spaces`

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf spaces

  Getting spaces in org example-org as admin...

  name
  development
</pre>

**View all users in a space by role**: `cf space-users ORGANIZATION_NAME SPACE_NAME`

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf space-users example-org development

  Getting users in org example-org / space development as admin

  SPACE MANAGER
    admin
    alice

  SPACE DEVELOPER
    admin
    delucia

  SPACE AUDITOR
</pre>

**Assign a space role to a user**: `cf set-space-role USERNAME ORGANIZATION_NAME SPACE_NAME ROLE`

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf set-space-role ExampleUser example-org development SpaceAuditor

  Assigning role SpaceAuditor to user ExampleUser in org example-org / space development as admin...
  OK
</pre>

**Remove a space role from a user**: `cf unset-space-role USERNAME ORGANIZATION_NAME SPACE_NAME ROLE`

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf unset-space-role ExampleUser example-org development SpaceAuditor

  Removing role SpaceAuditor to user ExampleUser in org example-org / space development as admin...
 OK
</pre>
