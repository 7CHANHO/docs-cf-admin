title: Accounting Report
---

The Accounting Report is a feature that allows admins to monitor instance usage. You can see the average and maximum app instances in use per month across the entire history of your PCF installation.

Average and maximum app instances in use per month are calculated from the `start`, `stop`, and `scale` app usage events in Cloud Controller. These tallies do not include activity in the **system** org, where PCF deploys utility apps such as Apps Manager, Apps Usage Service, Autoscaling, and Notifications.
