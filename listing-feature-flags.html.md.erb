<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Feature flags are switches that you set using the Cloud Controller API.
They allow an administrator to turn on or off functional sections of code, or features, of an application without deploying new code. Use feature flags to enable or disable features available to users.

There are nine feature flags that you can set. They are all enabled by default except `user_org_creation` and `diego_docker`. When disabled, these features are only available to administrators.
